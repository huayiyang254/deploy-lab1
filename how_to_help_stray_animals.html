    <div class="brief">
        <p>Helping stray animals is a challenging but meaningful task. Here are some methods that can help you rescue stray animals:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main-part row1">
        <div class="one">
            <h4>Looking for suitable adoption opportunities</h4>
            <p>If you are looking for a pet, consider
                adopting a stray animal instead of
                purchasing it. Go to the local shelter or
                adoption center to find cute friends who
                need a family.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
            <h4>Provide food and water</h4>
            <p>If you encounter stray animals, you can
                provide food and water, but please be
                cautious and avoid approaching potentially
                aggressive animals. Especially in
                situations related to wildlife, a safe
                distance should be maintained.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="main-part row2">
        <div class="three">
            <h4>Looking for an adoptive family</h4>
            <p>If you have the ability, you can help stray
                animals find permanent adoptive families.
                This may include posting photos and
                information of stray animals on social
                media to increase awareness, or
                collaborating with local animal adoption
                organizations to help promote activities
                to find adoptive families.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four">
            <h4>Volunteer</h4>
            <p>Join a local animal protection organization
                or homeless animal shelter as a volunteer.
                Volunteers can provide support such as care,
                socialization, cleaning, and medical care.
                Your time and effort can help improve the
                living conditions of stray animals, making
                them easier to adopt.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="main-part row3">
        <div class="five">
            <h4>Donations and Resources</h4>
            <p>If you don't have the time or opportunity
                to become a volunteer, you can consider
                donating to animal protection organizations
                to support their work. In addition, you can
                also donate food, bedding, toys, and other
                necessities to help meet the basic needs of
                stray animals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six">
            <h4>Education and publicity</h4>
            <p>educate the public about the importance of
                stray animal issues and how to prevent pet
                wandering. You can share relevant
                information on social media, participate
                in lectures or workshops, and help raise
                people's awareness of animal welfare.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="main-part row4">
        <div class="seven">
            <h4>Report found stray animals</h4>
            <p>If you discover stray animals, you should
                immediately contact the local animal control
                department, shelter, or animal protection
                organization. Provide as much information as
                possible so that they can take action, such
                as the location, appearance, and behavior of
                animals. If the animal is clearly injured or
                sick, you can also report it to the animal
                rescue organization.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>Helping stray animals requires patience, firm
            determination, and resource support. Through
            collective efforts, we can improve the living
            conditions of stray animals and provide them
            with a better future.</p>
