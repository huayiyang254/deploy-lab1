        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>I have always loved small animals, but because some of
            my family members have rhinitis, it is not suitable
            to keep pets. So I will go out and feed the kittens
            and puppies around the house, and I really enjoy
            spending time with them. But during this process, I
            also saw stray animals fighting for food, seeing
            infected wounds on their bodies, and even seeing
            some people taking pleasure in harming them. This
            makes me feel sad and angry, hoping to do something
            to help them.</p>
        <p>After further investigation, I found that the number
            of stray animals exceeded my imagination. According
            to data from 2019, there are over 600 million stray
            animals worldwide, with cats and dogs being the
            majority. And you may not imagine that among dogs,
            the number of stray dogs accounts for 33% of the
            total number of dogs.</p>

    <div class="why">
        <h1>WHY?</h1>
        <div class="animal-welfare">
            <h3>Animal Welfare</h3>
            <p>Stray animals often live in extremely difficult
                and dangerous conditions, without adequate food,
                water and shelter. By rescuing them, their
                quality of life can be improved and their pain
                and suffering can be alleviated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="animal-control">
            <h3>Animal Control</h3>
            <p>Controlling the number of stray animals can
                help prevent over breeding and overcrowding,
                reducing stray animals in cities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease-control">
            <h3>Disease Control</h3>
            <p>Stray animals can be vectors for spreading
                diseases, such as rabies. By capturing,
                treating and vaccinating stray animals, the
                spread of these diseases can be reduced and
                the health of communities protected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="community-safety">
            <h3>Community Safety</h3>
            <p> Some stray animals may become aggressive or
                dangerous, posing a threat to community
                residents. This threat can be reduced by
                rescuing and providing appropriate shelter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="moral-obligations">
            <h3>Moral Obligations</h3>
            <p>As humans, we have a responsibility to treat
                other living creatures with kindness and respect.
                Rescuing stray animals is a moral obligation that
                demonstrates our care and concern for their
                well-being.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="education-and-awareness-raising">
            <h3>Education and awareness raising</h3>
            <p>By rescuing stray animals, peopleâ€™s awareness
                of animal welfare issues can be raised, and they
                can be motivated to adopt more responsible pet
                ownership behaviours such as neutering and
                avoiding abandonment.</p>

            <h3>Psychological satisfaction</h3>
            <p>Rescuing stray animals can bring great
                satisfaction and joy. Animals that help
                these disadvantaged groups can make people
                feel satisfied and proud, and enhance social
                cohesion.</p>
